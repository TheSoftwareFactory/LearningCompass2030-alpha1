This is to hand over the project.

This project is written by the language ‘react native’. A relevant and useful reference:
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started
This project uses quick start (expo) environment.

Functions ad things to be improved:
1. Recommendation of interest in the home page is trivial. Algorithm can be introduced to du this. The parameters taking into consideration of the recommendation is the interest choice from the introduction page.
2. The recommendation result of the psychological test is also trivial. Makes it more useful.
3. The learning page of each of the 11 constructs is too easy. Different channels (see the structure diagram) can be used to do this. Also, different levels of difficulties and more complicated structure of subgroups of topics can be created.
4. The ‘share/communicate’ page is very meaningless. Either improve it a lot, or completely replace it.
5. Animation of introduction page, written by html, is loaded very slow. Either try to fix it, or replace it by another animation.
6. Statistics page in ‘More about background’ is written in html. It should be made more dynamic (i.e.) users should be able to edit and add the data.
7. The login system should actually contain the personal data into users’ account using Asyncstorage. Currently the structure is a key correspond to a password.
